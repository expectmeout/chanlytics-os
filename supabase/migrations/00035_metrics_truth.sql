-- 00035 Metrics truth: one definition of "who answered" and "how fast",
-- measured from the moment the reply actually left.
--
-- Two readers of the same rows disagreed. metrics_summary (Today) counted a
-- customer message as answered by the receptionist if ANY later AI reply
-- existed and by you if ANY later human reply existed -- not exclusively --
-- so the take-over / hand-back loop made one message count twice, Today's
-- "answered by the receptionist" read 2 of 2 beside Reports' 1 / 1 for the
-- same day, and the hero arc lied. report_series (Reports) took the FIRST
-- replier. Both timed the receptionist from the row's created_at, which is
-- the DRAFT moment: under a veto window the reply is written as `queued` and
-- sent delay_ms later, so every reply-time number was short by the hold.
--
-- first_replies is the one rule. The send moment is the `message.sent` event
-- when there is one (the queued path) and the row's created_at otherwise (the
-- edge inserts an immediate reply as `sent`). SECURITY INVOKER like its two
-- callers: RLS scopes every inner select to the caller's workspaces.
--
-- metrics_summary also gains the guards its sibling had -- `set search_path`
-- and a revoke from public/anon -- and a DST-safe window.
