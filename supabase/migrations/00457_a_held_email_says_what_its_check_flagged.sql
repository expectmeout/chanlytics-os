-- 00457: a held email says what its check flagged, on the lead's own story.
--
-- A sequence's People tab names what a held email's check flagged (sequence_sends.hold_detail: the opening's words that
-- their record does not hold, a chain's count); the lead sheet read the same send from the lead's story, which carried
-- only why it was held, so its box said "the opening said something their record doesn't hold" and its Decide asked
-- for an answer about an email it could not show. reach_out_lead_timeline's sends now carry hold_detail too. Nothing
-- else in the function changes: its text is 00455's with that one key added.
