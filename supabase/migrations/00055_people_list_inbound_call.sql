-- 00055 · "Asked" means they reached out.
--
-- The row's last call was any call, so a call the owner placed read as the
-- person reaching out, and the Asked-never-booked list and the asked-to-
-- booked line counted it. The list now carries the last INBOUND call
-- beside the last call of any direction; the readers use the inbound one
-- for "asked" and keep the other for "last contact".
--
-- A return-type change is a drop and a create; the grants are re-stated.
