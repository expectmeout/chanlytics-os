-- 00328 · A person's every open deal (decision 0029, step 1).
--
-- A person may hold one open deal per service (deals_open_uq: a proposal out for one, a client of another), and
-- people_list returned one deal a person, the newest open: the rest were on no row, so the Pipeline never listed them,
-- People's deal lists left them out and the proposal follow-up never named them. people_list now also returns
-- `open_deals`, every open deal, newest first, beside the one deal the row shows (unchanged, so either deploy order
-- works). Copied from its latest migration (00320) with only that change; the return type grows, so it is dropped and
-- created again, and its grants and comment restated.

The page is chosen before it is read (0021, people_page): its people come from person_moments in one whole order, latest contact first (in_touch_at, -infinity for never), then the newest added (added_at), then the id, falling, at most p_limit (1000) of them after p_offset or after the cursor p_after_at, p_after_added, p_after_id (the last row''s in_touch_at, added_at and id); every other column is read for them alone.
