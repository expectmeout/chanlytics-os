-- 00329 · A campaign is counted by its channel (decision 0030, step 1).
--
-- campaign_series counted what the broadcasts and playbook runs sent, and what came of it, over every channel at once:
-- a text or an email has no read receipt, so the period's read share fell with every one sent, and nothing said how
-- each channel did. It now also returns `by_channel`, the current period's sent, delivered, read and replied for each
-- channel that sent (broadcast_recipients.channel, 00298; a row naming none went by WhatsApp, as every run before
-- channels did). Everything else it returns is unchanged, so either deploy order works. Copied from its latest
-- migration (00320) with only that change; only the body changes, so `create or replace` takes it, and the grants
-- and comment are restated.
