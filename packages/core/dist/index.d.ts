/**
 * deliver(): the one door a message leaves through.
 *
 * Four sequences used to put words on a wire, each assembled by hand: the
 * outbox job asked "opted out?" and nothing about the thread, the broadcast
 * asked the one predicate with the template's purpose and then checked the
 * pause, the voice booking link asked a gate of its own, and the webhook's
 * reply is the statement order of a 300-line function. They disagreed about
 * the pause and about marketing consent, and the disagreements were the
 * defects: a promotional template reaching someone who had said yes to
 * appointments and no to offers; a held draft firing under the owner's own
 * words.
 *
 * This is the door for the first three, and the shape the fourth grows into.
 * It RE-READS the facts at the wire -- the person's consent, the thread's
 * pause, the workspace's status -- because the moment before the send is the
 * one place a stale answer cannot be taken back. It knows nothing about who
 * should be told when a send fails: it returns what happened, and the caller
 * (a job with an owner to alert, a broadcast with a recipient to mark, a
 * voice agent with a caller waiting) says so in its own words.
 *
 * Every send NAMES ITS PURPOSE. A template's purpose is what Meta says it is
 * (purposeOfTemplate fails closed to marketing); words in a conversation are
 * conversational. A send is PROACTIVE when it starts a conversation rather
 * than answering one, and that decides whether a recorded yes is needed for
 * conversational words at all.
